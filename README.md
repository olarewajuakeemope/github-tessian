# Github scalable
A simple Github repository issues crawling application

## Features
1. search github users
2. view searched users repos
3. view user repos issues
4. filter user repos issues by date, creator, milestone, mentioned name, labels, sort, direction, assignee and state

## ES6 Features used
1. Arrow functions - Used for simplicity and to avoid binding class methods
2. Classes - Used in order to avoid prototypical class structures
3. Template strings - Used to avoid concatenating strings and other types
4. Destructuring - Used to avoid excessive nested dot expressions
5. Default + Rest + Spread - Used to easily pass Array and Object entries to a new data structure
6. Let and Const - Used in order to enable closures on identifiers and let the compiler determine if an identifier will change over time
7. Generators - Used in redux-saga
8. Modular import - Used to avoid require import syntax
9. Async await functions - Used to let the compiler know it has to await the result of another function before proceeding with execution

###### Typecript was also used to help catch potential bugs by implementing type checking
